## Introduction

Recording, measuring and analysing personal drug consumption; including medicinal and recreational/habitual.

### The data

Base data includes (of the observation) the date and time, location (postcode), and the activity being recorded.

## Analysis

Here is a very quick plot of the data.

```{r}
with(selfData, qplot(DateTime, Activity, alpha=I(0.25)))
```

### Consumption by weekdays

By grouping daily consumption and then averaging across weekdays, the below plot shows something like how an average week of consumption looks.

```{r}
ggplot(wdayAvg, aes(x = Weekday, y = Average, color = Activity, group = Activity)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    geom_line()
```

### iOS Health/Activity cross-examination

Merging physical activity data can show some correlations with certain kinds of consumption. Here, active (non-basal) calorie burning is plotted against consumption categories.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
source("activity.R")
```

```{r}
qplot(kcals, value, data = activityVsConsumption, facets = .~variable, alpha=I(0.25)) + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
