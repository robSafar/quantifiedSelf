## Introduction

Recording, measuring and analysing personal drug consumption; including medicinal and recreational/habitual.

### The data

Base data includes (of the observation) the date and time, location (postcode), and the activity being recorded.

Basic cleaning and processing takes place in the accompanying `script.R` file.

```{r}
str(selfData)
```

## Analysis

Here is a very quick plot of the data.

```{r}
with(selfData, qplot(DateTime, Activity, alpha=I(0.25)))
```

### Weekdays

By grouping daily consumption and then averaging across weekdays, the below plot shows something like how an average week of consumption looks.

```{r}
ggplot(wdayAvg, aes(x = Weekday, y = Average, color = Activity, group = Activity)) + geom_point() + geom_line()
```
