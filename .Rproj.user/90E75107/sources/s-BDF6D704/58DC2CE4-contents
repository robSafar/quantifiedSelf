# quantifiedSelf
Resources for analysing personal 'quantified self' data

## Notes

- Cleaning, processing and analysis executes from the `report.Rmd` file. A fair amount of code is run from separate `.R` files for ease of development, but that code can just as easily be pasted into the `.Rmd` file replacing the respective `source()` lines. 
- Monitored data loads from iCloud Drive folder, after being created using the iOS Workflow app. 
- Now integrates iOS Health/Activity data - archive should load from `~/Downloads` folder.
    - As this involves loading from a sizeable `.xml` file, processing might now take a couple of minutes. 
- The `.gitignore` file is used to omit the data and output from this repository. This is an open methodology project, rather than open data.

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org)
    - `ggplot2` package for plotting graphics
    - `knitr` package for weaving the R Markdown analysis
